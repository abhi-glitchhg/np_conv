# np_conv

Implementations of convolutions in numpy without for loops.

convs go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr


# TODO


- [X] Conv2D
- [ ] Conv3D

The goal is to have more features like dilations, strides, and if possible groups. (For more info, checkout pytorch implementations of convolutions.)
